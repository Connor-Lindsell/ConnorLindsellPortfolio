  Stacked Planetary Gear Drive Actuator Control with Button Input
  Description of code:
  This code controls a stepper motor that drives a stacked planetary gear system using a step 
  and direction driver. The motor movement is triggered by a button press, allowing for manual 
  control of the motorâ€™s movement. The motor rotates in a specified direction while the button 
  is held down and stops when the button is released. This provides a simple, intuitive way 
  to control motor movement for applications requiring user interaction.

  Key features:
  1. Button-Controlled Movement: The motor moves only when the button is pressed. The motor 
     stops rotating as soon as the button is released, allowing precise control of movement.
     
  2. Direction Control: The direction of rotation is defined by the `clockwise` variable. 
     By default, the motor rotates clockwise. The direction pin is configured accordingly.
     
  3. Speed Control: The speed of the motor is controlled by a delay between each step, defined 
     by the `speed` variable in microseconds. A lower value of `speed` results in faster rotation.
     
  4. Manual Override: The system provides flexibility for manual control, making it useful in 
     scenarios where step-by-step precision is important, or where the user needs to control 
     the motor intermittently.

  Application: 
  This code is ideal for applications where user intervention is required to control the motor, 
  such as positioning systems, robotic actuators, or motorized mechanisms that need manual 
  override functionality. The use of a stacked planetary gear system ensures high torque and 
  precise angular control.
