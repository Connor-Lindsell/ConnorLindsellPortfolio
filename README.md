# ProfessionalProjects
Welcome to my Project Portfolio on GitHub! This repository contains a curated collection of projects I have undertaken, both through university coursework and personal initiatives. Each project folder includes detailed documentation, source code, and additional resources to help you understand the objectives and outcomes of each project.

Contents 

University Projects: These projects were completed as part of my engineering coursework, covering various aspects of mechanical and robotic design.
Personal Projects: Initiatives I undertook independently to further my knowledge and skills in robotics, programming, and engineering design.

Getting Started

To get started with exploring these projects, you can navigate to individual project directories from the root of this repository. Each directory typically contains:

src: The source code files or engineering designs
doc: Documentation, including project reports and design files
data: Any data files used or generated by the projects

Prerequisites

Before running any project codes, ensure you have the required environments and libraries installed, as specified in the project-specific README files.

Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further information about any of the projects.
